## Introduction
Linux Usage Agent is an internal tool that monitors the resources of hosts within a cluster. It could help the infrastructure team to better monitor, analyze, and allocate resources for each host. 
## Architecture and Design
A PostgreSQL database that contains the basic info and usage data of each host will be served from one of the hosts.
